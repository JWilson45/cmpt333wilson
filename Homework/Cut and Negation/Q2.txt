Yes, using a cut fail combination would help as implementing cuts prevents backtracking on old terms when substituting onto a new term. Once substituted, we do not want that to be undone, and backtracking would keep the changes "solidified" so to speak. Once the substitution occurs, the process should be complete for that term and will not need to backtracked. Adding a cut fail would also allow for explicit conditions to be omitted. This is because one the program executes the fail, those explicit ending conditions will not get used. The cut fail would increase the efficiency of the code having less arguments / branches be explored.
